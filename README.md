This mod allows you to connect to [BingoSync](https://bingosync.com/) directly in-game. This allows you to play a bingo game without leaving the game.

> [!WARNING]
> This mod is still WIP. Bugs can occur, and not every feature is yet available.

### How to use

If you are a player, you will simply have to fill out the information, then press `Play`. It will try to connect to the room.

If you are the host, you will have to go on [the website](https://bingosync.com/), and create a room using this JSON:

```json

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure everyone has the same goal files. Players can have more than the host, but they need to have every goal used on the board.

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the mod doesn't allow you to create rooms in-game. However, it is a planned feature for the future!

### Goals

This mod comes bundled with a lot of goals. They are mostly simple, but they allow some variety.

Users can also create their own goal using the available actions. Every goal under `Goals/` will be loaded on launch.

> [!WARNING]
> There is currently no condensed source of information that teaches how to make goals. It is suggested to see how bundled goals are made, and try to copy them.

## Contributing
